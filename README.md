### Hi there 👋
Hello! My name is Ludmila Almiron.

I've been studying and practicing Full Stack Web Development for more than a year. During this time, I participated in several courses and explored in a self-taught way, which has given me a solid foundation in logic, analytical thinking, and design patterns. However, I am aware of the current demands of the IT market and I am really committed to continuous learning and training.

Although I have Full Stack skills, I am more inclined towards Front End Development as I am a deeply creative person and interested in art in general, and I feel my skills excel more in that sector. However, my creativity is not limited to design; I also apply it to problem-solving and creating efficient solutions.

In addition to my creativity, what sets me apart is my dedication and determination. I am committed to every project I participate in and determined to achieve every goal I set for myself.

When it comes to teamwork, I strive to be the best teammate possible. I highly value communication, empathy, and mutual support, and I believe these are the fundamental pillars to achieve common goals.

I am open to any opportunity to collaborate on different types of projects, to keep learning and growing in the world of technology, and to contribute with my skills.
